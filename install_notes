looking at the docker file provided by the authors, it appears to just be the setup for a python environment, I'm doesn't look like it installs deeplabcut in the recipie file. 

I'll try installing using the tensorflow recipie that justin created

have to change the version of wxpython wheel to match both the os version (ubuntu 16.04) and the python version (3.5)
Once that was fixed, the image built, but importing deeplabcut in python in the image throws a libgtk-3.so.0: cannot open shared object
added apt-get installs for gtk3, build-essential, and python3-tk, which appear to have fixed those issues. 

To run:
on aci-i, with graphical interface:
singularity run --nv deeplabcut_tensorflow.simg 
import deeplabcut
